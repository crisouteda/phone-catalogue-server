## üíª Development

These instructions will allow you to get a working copy of the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### üìã Prerequisites

You need to have installed Node JS. Developed with v17.9.0.
Also, an account in Amazon Web Services (AWS) is needed.

### üîß Installation

1. Download this repository as zip or clone the repository on your device (if you clone the repository, note that you will not be able to add your commits).
2. Open a terminal in the root directory of the repository.
3. Install the local dependencies by running the command in the terminal:

```
npm install
```

or

```
yarn
```

4. Some environmental variables are needed. Create a .env file with the following keys:

- **AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID**: Specifies an AWS access key associated with an IAM user or role.
- **AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY**: Specifies the secret key associated with the access key. This is essentially the "password" for the access key.
- **AWS_DEFAULT_REGION**: Specifies the AWS Region to send the request to.
- **TOKEN_SECRET**: random secret to hash passwords
- **STAGE_ENVIRONMNET**: to handle the environment and used to call the right database. staging and prod have been used

### üèÅ Starting the project

To serve the app locally run:

```
npm run start
```

or

```
yarn start
```

If you want to re-run the server every time you change the code source:

```
npm run watch
```

or

```
yarn watch
```

### üöÄ Deployment to Heroku

The present backend is deployed in [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/reference), a CI/CD tool.

- [staging](https://phone-catalogue-server-staging.herokuapp.com/)
  Push the changes to `main` branch in Github, heroku will run

- [prod](https://phone-catalogue-server.herokuapp.com/)
  Push to changes

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools

### Database

- The databse used is DynamoDB. It has been chosen for being a NoSQL database. This gives some extra flexibility to the data and the phone providers to add the data they prefer about the phone specifications. This particular NoSQL database was selected because AWS provides a SDK to handle easily and fast the CRUD actions. aws-sdk (version ^2.1110.0)

## üìù Following improvements and TODOS

- DELETE and PUT requests have been changed to be POST requests because of an error with CORS when calling the endpoints from the frontend.

- Token must be send in the body instead of in the headers because of an error with CORS when calling the endpoints from the frontend.
